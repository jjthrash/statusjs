status.js

dependencies: prototype.js, effects.js, lowpro.js

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows you to display a status message when submiting a form. To use,
simply add the following to application.js:

  Event.addBehavior({'form': Status.FormBehavior()});

And then add an "onsubmit_status" to each form that you want to display
a status message on submit for:

  <form onsubmit_status="Saving changes" ...>

Some code taken from popup.js.
